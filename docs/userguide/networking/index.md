# Docker network overview

The following sections tackle all of the above topics in an order that we can move roughly from simplest to most complex.

- [Understand Docker container networks](dockernetworks.md)
- [Work with network commands](work-with-networks.md)
- [Get started with multi-host networking](get-started-overlay.md)


Old stuff to be determined:

- [Binding container ports to the host](binding.md)
- [Building your own bridge](build-bridges.md)
- [Configuring DNS](configure-dns.md)
- [How Docker networks a container](container-basics.md)
- [Communication between containers and the wider world](container-communication.md)
- [Customizing docker0](custom-docker0.md)  
- [IPv6 with Docker](ipv6.md)  
- [Quick guide to the options](options.md)
- [Tools and examples](tools.md)
